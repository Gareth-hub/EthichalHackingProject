#In order to set up a firewall in Kali Linux you must first install it, this can be done with the following command:
sudo apt-get install ufw

# Once installed you can then check what tools/apps are compatible with the firewall
sudo ufw app list

#The status of the firewall can be checked using either of the following two commands

sudo ufw status

#or 

sudo ufw status verbose

#In order to activate the firewall and enable it to run on system start up enter the following command:
sudo ufw enable

#This firewall can later be stopped and disabled from running on system start up by entering the following command:
sudo ufw disable

#If you wish for your firewall to block all names/outside connections then you can skip this part
#Otherwise to approve a connection or name run the following commands
#For connections use the command 'sudo ufw allow' followed by the port number as shown below
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

#For names enter the command 'sudo ufw allow' and followed by the name as shown below
sudo ufw allow myself

#If you chose to implement these permission you can check them by running the following command:
sudo ufw status verbose

#An example of how a firewall can be used on a website to secure it
#denying alll connections from http 80 service and allowing http 443 service protects a website from a hackers potential exploits
sudo ufw deny 80
sudo ufw allow 443
